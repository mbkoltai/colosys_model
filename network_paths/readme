# the R scripts
~/research/models/KRAS_DNA_repair_model/network_paths/pathfinder_functions.R
~/research/models/KRAS_DNA_repair_model/network_paths/pathfinder.R
# are the code to connect 2 groups of nodes with 1,2,3 intermediate, and the functions that do this

# the original 15-node model is shown in

# the csv file
~/research/models/KRAS_DNA_repair_model/network_paths/one_intermediate_paths.csv
# is the output from the R scripts where i extracted paths from the SIGNOR network
~/research/models/KRAS_DNA_repair_model/network_paths/SIGNOR_all_simplified.tsv
# to connect the 15 node model to the genes of the new readouts and genes that were most commonly mutated
# the results were loaded into the cytoscape session

# the folder
~/research/models/KRAS_DNA_repair_model/network_paths/figures

# the CytoScape file 
~/research/models/KRAS_DNA_repair_model/network_paths/model_expansion.cys
# contains the influence graph by Markus/Natalie as "markus_network_SIF.csv"
# I edited this network by adding missing connections and removing some unconstrained nodes 
# the edited network is 
SIF_edited_modeling
# to this I added positive autoloops to the nodes that describe self-sustaining states, this network is
SIF_edited_modeling_with_autoloops

# this is exported into SIF format
~/KRAS_DNA_repair_model/network_paths/markus_network_edited_modeling_with_autoloops.sif
# into PDF as
